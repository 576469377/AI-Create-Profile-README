# Bug Fixes and Improvements Summary

## 🐛 Bugs Fixed

### 1. optimize-line-lengths.sh Counter Bug
**Problem**: The template processed counter always showed 0 due to variable scope issues with piped commands.
**Solution**: Replaced pipe with process substitution (`< <(find ...)`) to avoid subshell variable scope problems.
**Result**: Counter now correctly shows the number of processed templates.

### 2. setup.sh Username Handling
**Problem**: Script used git config user.name instead of provided --username for display name.
**Solution**: Prioritize provided username over git config when available.
**Result**: Generated profiles now correctly use the specified username.

### 3. setup.sh Argument Parsing
**Problem**: Script didn't handle --non-interactive flag and had no error handling for unknown arguments.
**Solution**: Added proper handling for --non-interactive flag and error messages for unknown arguments.
**Result**: Improved command-line interface with better error handling.
